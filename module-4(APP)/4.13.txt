13) Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python? 

If you have some suspicious code that may raise an exception, you can defend your 
program by placing the suspicious code in a try: block. 
After the try: block, include an except: statement, 
followed by a block of code which handles the problem as elegantly as possible.


Errors are problems that occur in the program due to an illegal operation performed by the 
user or by the fault of a programmer, which halts the normal flow of the program. 
Errors are also termed bugs or faults. There are mainly two types of errors in python programming. 

Syntax errors
Logical Errors or Exceptions
Whenever we do not write the proper syntax of the python programming language (or any other language) then
the python interpreter throws an error known as a syntax error.

On the other hand, Logical Errors are those errors that cannot be caught during compilation time. 
As we cannot check these errors during compile time, we name them Exceptions.
Exceptions can cause some serious issues so we should handle them effectively.
